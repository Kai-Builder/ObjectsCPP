# Parsing & Packaging With dip.Parse \(\)

Next, We'll Use the Parse\(\) Function to begin parsing.

Remember to Keep one Space between Parse & \(\)



```python
// Begin The Module Parser

!print Setting Up your Module Now

dip.parse -> ("ThisModule")

return 0 // When Process Is Done
```

After that, Run your Script.

This should be the Output.

```python
Setting Up your Module Now.

Initializing DIP_INSTALLER. . .

dip_packages - 1.2201%
dip_ins - 10290
elsstatdip - 1903

Finished Parsing Data!
```
