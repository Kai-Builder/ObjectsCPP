# What Are Value Requests?

A Value Request In Exclamation \(Using the this-&gt; Operator\), Are Getters That Take Values from the Exclamation API. This Helps Easily Tokenize the Values and Prevent Further Exceptions & Errors.

The Syntax Of Requesting Is As Follows.

```cpp
this-> bool x = true | false
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Requested Values Are Constant R-Values. See Next Page For Do's And Don'ts
{% endhint %}

Now Obviously, Booleans Aren't the Only Value. The List Is Found at the Bottom Of the Document. At **API Reference.** 

API Requests Are The Same In C++ Using the GetFunctionByDefinition NoReturn Function.

The Next Page Explains How these Functions Work.
