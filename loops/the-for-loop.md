# The For Loop

Using the For Loop Is pretty Complicated. \(NOT IN GRAMMAR OF COURSE\) But in the Source code behind it.

The For Loop Only Has One Setting.

`for word in <foo` \(usually SessionParameters, and more`>`

When Using Basic For Loops, It Prints EEEEVERYTHING Stored Inside of the Session \(bools, ints, doubles, etc\)

It's Very Easy to use, Very strong If Used Right.

Next Page Discusses How The If Statement/Loop Is Implemented.
