# What Is a Module \(Following The ESTCG\)

Modules are simple, C++ Operated Modifications To Exclamation Script And It Allows The User to Do Certain Things Not available In Vanilla Exclamation17.

The API Reference Has ALL Of the Documentation You need to get started On Building your Own Exclamation SP \(Script Package\).

This Part of the Documentation Goes over some basic Functionality Of the C++ API And How to Use it.

Modules Have existed Since 1.0 And were not properly Implemented Until ExclamationLanguage17.

The DPM \(Dip Package Manager\) Can Install, Remove, Help, And Fix Modules Within Exclamation Language.

The !pre\_include Function Is a Targeted function that adds integration with certain Libraries within Exclamation.

PreIncludes Are DEEPLY INTEGRATED. MODULES ARE MORE DYNAMIC BECAUSE THEY ARE STORED IN THE SITE-PACKAGES!

And I Repeat, This list will Not have AS MUCH documentation As the API Reference Section Will.
